# Case: 2025 Recommendation for Internal Capital Deployment
This is an independent case, set at the end of 2024, where we assume a role inside a theoretical risk control division at SEB and analyze to the choice of different investment strategies over the 2025 operating year to meet certain goals, using forecasts, modeling and prospective simulations to recommend a strategy for managing a specific portfolio. 

Although it is hopefully already apparent to the reader: this case is an entirely theoretical and independent analyst project that is not commisioned by or affiliated with SEB in any capacity.
